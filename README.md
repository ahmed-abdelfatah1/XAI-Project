# XAI-Project
•	Implemented and compared 9 different classification algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP, Decision Tree, CatBoost, SVC, Logistic Regression, KNN, Naïve-Bayes).
•	Integrated multiple Explainable AI (XAI) techniques including SHAP, LIME, Partial Dependence Plots, and ICE to enhance model transparency.
•	Performed comprehensive feature importance analysis identifying ST-slope, chest pain type, cholesterol, and age as key predictors
•	Conducted interaction analysis using Friedman H-statistic and LOFO to discover non-linear relationships between clinical variables
•	Established a methodology balancing high predictive performance with clinical interpretability for healthcare applications
